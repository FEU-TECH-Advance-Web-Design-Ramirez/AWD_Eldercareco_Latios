# Eldercareco Documentation

## Overview

Eldercareco is a comprehensive platform designed to manage and streamline elder care services. It aims to provide a seamless experience for caregivers and family members to monitor and manage the well-being of elderly individuals.

## Past Work

In our past work, we created a mockup design for Eldercareco. The design prototype is available on Figma and includes the following elements:
- About Us page
- Hero Page
- Logo
- Main Page

You can view the design prototype on Figma [here](https://www.figma.com/design/0mDkc8Pw1GTQ3On49MDFsy/Untitled?node-id=9-2&t=exyNne46f8J5wXS9-1).

## Current Status

Currently, we are in the process of converting the mockup design into a real, functional design. The code is being developed in Visual Studio Code and is not yet complete. The project structure is as follows:

## Development Plan

### Week 1
- Designing the code in Figma.
- Finalizing the mockup design.

### Week 2
- Starting the coding process.
- Updating new designs on Figma as needed.
